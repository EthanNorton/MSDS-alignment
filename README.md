# Intro

This repostitory is a path through my graduate journey at Northwestern. I was initally accepted into the Analytics Management Certificate program, but wanted to go deeper into the program.
There will be a seperate branch for the specific course, which I will share the projects/content in accordance to course/university policy.

## About my Journey in Grad School 

I was waived from MSDS 400 and MSDS 401 due to adequate substitute courses. I enrolled in multiple algorithms courses, and earned an A at UIUC's CS 401.
Additionally, my statistics background was also waived due to high performance in: Time Series Analysis, Applied Econometrics, and another statistical equivalance of Econometrics from computational side. 

My first class will be MSDS 476, which will be a solid foundation for how to think big picture of facilitating improvements, and learn how to integrate more technical learnings throughout the program. 

The depth courses I am planning are Intelligent Systems and Robotics(https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=5012), as well as

The above image shows the core courses necessary, in addition to MSDS 476. I waived two, so the other 6 are necessary. The **four** electives I am thinking are:
-_Analytics Systems Engineering_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php#) **Page not currently avaiable.**
-_Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4783) **pre-requisite, help for the two below**
-_Intelligent Systems and Robotics_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=5012)
-_Applied Probability and Simulation Modeling_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4779) 
-_Data Pipelines and Stream Processing_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php#) **Page not currently avaiable.** **OR** 

Finally, the last step would be a Capstone or Thesis Research project, which would be guided by Learning repository throughout the program of applied research and projects.
I'll likely pass on one of the above 5 that I'll be able to learn on my own/enroll in later.
