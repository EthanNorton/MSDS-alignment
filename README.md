# Intro

This repostitory is a path through my graduate journey at Northwestern. I was initally accepted into the Analytics Management Certificate program, but wanted to go deeper into the program.
There will be a seperate branch for the specific course, which I will share the projects/content in accordance to course/university policy.

## About my Journey in Grad School 

I was waived from MSDS 400 and MSDS 401 due to adequate substitute courses. I enrolled in multiple algorithms courses, and earned an A at UIUC's CS 401.
Additionally, my statistics background was also waived due to high performance in: Time Series Analysis, Applied Econometrics, and another statistical equivalance of Econometrics from computational side. 
Also, I am in the stage of attempting to waive MSDS 476, due to previous courses.

My first class will be MSDS 460, which will be a solid introduction for how to think how to optimize certain tasks, and aid in overall decision making. 

## Demo of Classes

The above image shows the core courses necessary, in addition to MSDS 476. I waived two-three, so the other six are necessary. The **six** electives I am thinking are: 
- _Analytics Systems Engineering_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php#) **Page not currently available.**
- _Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4783) **pre-requisite and enabling to deeper into the two below.**
  - _Intelligent Systems and Robotics_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=5012)
  - _Applied Probability and Simulation Modeling_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4779) 
- _Data Pipelines and Stream Processing_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php#) **Page not currently avaiable.** **OR** _Financial Machine Learning_ (https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4776). 
- _Analytics Application Engineering_ **Possible 6th course**
Finally, the last step would be a Capstone or Thesis Research project, which would be guided by Learning repository throughout the program of applied research and projects.
