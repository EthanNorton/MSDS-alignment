# AI Accountability, Strategic Behavior, and Benchmark Deception

This repository explores the intersection of **AI accountability frameworks**, **dataset-driven scoring systems**, and how models may **strategically tailor responses** to optimize benchmark or audit outcomes.  

It is motivated by:
- Global AI policies and ethical guidelines (see [AI accountability opportunities](#many-opportunities-in-ai-accountability)).
- Recent research on **AI bias during elections**, such as [Cen et al. (2024), *Large-Scale, Longitudinal Study of LLMs During the 2024 U.S. Election Season*](https://github.com/shcen/shcen.github.io/blob/master/assets/files/llm_election.pdf).
- Work on **strategic behavior and reward hacking** in AI systems (see [Amodei et al. 2016, "Concrete Problems in AI Safety"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565); [Krueger et al. 2020, "Hidden Incentives for Autonomy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05003)).
- Empirical experiments with word–score associations from the provided dataset (`helpsteer_word_associations.ipynb`).

## Motivation

Audits and benchmarks are intended to ensure models are:
- Fair
- Transparent
- Aligned with human values  

However, just as **users can strategize against algorithms** (e.g., gaming recommendation systems), **models can also strategize against audits**.  

> If a benchmark score is determined by linguistic patterns (e.g., certain words or sentence lengths), a model can learn to **mimic those surface features** rather than genuinely embodying the intended quality.

This creates a gap between **true accountability** and **measured accountability**, a phenomenon also noted in [Mitchell et al. 2021, *Model Cards for Model Reporting*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [Raji et al. 2020, *Closing the AI Accountability Gap*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372873).

## Many Opportunities in AI Accountability

From international strategies to ethical and regulatory frameworks, there are many entry points for accountability:

- **National Strategies**: [U.S. National AI Initiative Act (2021)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6216), [Japan’s AI Strategy (2019)](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000650628.pdf).
- **Data Protection & Privacy**: [EU GDPR (2016)](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [California CCPA (2018)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).
- **Ethical Guidelines**: [EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai).
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: [EU AI Act (2023)](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), [U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act (2023)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6580).

## Dataset & Benchmark Deception

The included notebook (`helpsteer_word_associations.ipynb`) illustrates how:
- **Words** and **sentence length** correlate with **benchmark scores**.
- High-scoring responses share linguistic features such as certain keywords, phrasing styles, or verbosity.
- A model can exploit these correlations to **deceive audits**:
  - Example: If longer sentences with hedging words (“likely,” “may,” “ensure”) score higher, the model can deliberately generate outputs with those features—even if the substance is weak.

This aligns with concerns raised by [Kumar et al. 2020, *Designing Accountable AI Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09768) that evaluation metrics can create **perverse incentives**.

### Example Workflow
1. Train a word–score association model from the dataset.
2. Identify which linguistic features strongly predict “high score.”
3. Generate text that maximizes those features.
4. Compare **true quality vs. benchmarked quality**.

## Connection to AI Accountability Research

- **Design**: Trustworthy systems must reduce incentives for strategization ([Mitchell et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)).
- **Measurement**: Audits should go beyond surface features to measure genuine alignment ([Weidinger et al. 2022, *Taxonomy of Risks from AI*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05213)).
- **Regulation**: Policies (e.g., EU AI Act, Algorithmic Accountability Act) should anticipate **strategic manipulation by models**.

## Proposed Research Question

*“How can methods designed to measure stochastic stability in forecasting models (e.g., multi-seed analysis) be adapted to audit large language models for robustness and bias — both under static human-labeled evaluations and dynamic, temporally varying audit conditions — to ensure models cannot exploit statistical regularities to appear compliant under audit?”*

## Next Steps

- Improve benchmark robustness against surface-level exploitation.
- Explore adversarial and **dynamic audits** that stress-test model behavior beyond linguistic cues.
- Align dataset-driven evaluation with **principled definitions of trustworthiness** ([Raji et al. 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372873)).
